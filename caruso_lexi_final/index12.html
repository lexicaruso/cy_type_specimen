                <p>Sometimes I wonder
                <br>
                When I'm grocery shopping
                <br>
                If I'll walk past you
                <br>
	            And not even realize it.
                </p>
                
                <p>I'm not sure we would
                <br>
                Recognize eachother
                <br>
                For the years have changed us
                <br>
                In more ways than one.
                </p>
        
                <p>The I hate I held for you
                <br>
	            Has been long gone.
                <br>
                For awhile, it projected onto myself-
                <br>
                a little reminder inside my head saying
                <br>
                "You are an imposter."
                </p>
                
                <p>I've spent more time without you
                <br>
                And yet I still somehow remember
                <br>
	            The sound of your voice.
                </p>
        
                <p>I don't hold onto the bad anymore.
                <br>
                Only the good.
                <br>
	            Playing tennis,
                <br>
                Picking out movies at Blockbuster,
                <br>
	            Playing drumset while you played guitar,
                <br>
                Eating at your favorite Chinese restaurant.
                </p>
        
                <p>It takes a long time to understand
                <br>
                The things that happened to me as a kid.
                <br>
                I'm not sure I'll ever have all the answers
                <br>
                And I don't blame anyone anymore.
                </p>

                <p>All I know now is I am thankful
                <br>
                For all the things you taught me.
                </p>

                <p>I am thankful I've reached a point now
                <br>
                Where I can tell where you end
                <br>
                And I begin.
                <br>
                </p>
