            <p>Created by Jürgen Huber at the type foundry, Supertype, 
            Cy is an unpredictable geometric sans-serif with nine 
            weights and 801 glyphs. When using Cy, each letter is 
            different than the last. In Adobe programs such as 
            Illustrator or InDesign, the geometry can be controlled by 
            highlighting an individual glyph.</p>

            <p>Located in Berlin, Germany, Jürgen Huber and Martin 
            Wenzel are the founders of Supertype. Jürgen studied 
            communication design at University in Essen. He worked as 
            a designer at MetaDesign, Berlin before establishing 
            Supertype with Martin. Martin also studied communication 
            design and typography at the KABK Royal Academy, the 
            Hauge. Following his degree, he worked at Petr van 
            Blokland where he drew type and learned Python. Both 
            Jürgen and Martin teach typography to communication 
            design students at HTW University in Berlin.</p>

            <p>Described by Type Network as oddly eye-catching, Cy will 
            make you do a double-take. Taking form of both round and 
            squared geometry, Cy achieves versatility with an 
            ever-changing mood. Cy is supported by 135 languages 
            and ideal for branding, games, headlines, and labels. For 
            any business hoping to stand out with engaging, lively, and 
            unpredictable glyphs, Cy will not disappoint.</p></div>
