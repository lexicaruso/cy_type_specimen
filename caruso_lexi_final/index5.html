        <div class="h3"><h3>poem by James Kavanaugh</h3></div>
        
                <div class="poem">
                <p>There was so much I wanted to say
                <br>
                But it got lost among recipes and yesterday’s movies
                <br>
                And all the things that strangers talk about
                <br>
	            To keep the silence from ticking too loud.
                </p>
                
                <p>Our different worlds met in the night
                <br>
                And waved as we went by—
                <br>
                Each leaning on our axis—
                <br>
                Each surrounded by a different set of stars,
                <br>
	            Even a separate moon.
                </p>
        
                <p>We were children last night—
                <br>
	            Begging a parent to look and see
                <br>
                While we did somersaults to please,
                <br>
                Looking for the word or smile that said: <b>“You’re loved!”</b>
                </p>
                
                <p>I woke this morning with futility and loneliness
                <br>
                Wondering if there could ever rise that moment of joy,
                <br>
	            Or if my very being made it impossible.
                </p>
        
                <p>Perhaps the Christians are right­—
                <br>
	            Self-sacrifice is back in style,
                <br>
                Perhaps man has no right to be himself,
                <br>
	            To find love in the night.
                </p>
        
                <p>But I have known love—
                <br>
                Known moments when my very giving
                <br>
	            Was as spontaneous as the sunlight.
                </p>

            <p>Then followed other times.
            <br>
            <b><i>But they will pass,</i></b>
	        <h2><i>And love will come again.</h2></i>
            </p>
