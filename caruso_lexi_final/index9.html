                <p><b>“Do you ever think about how small we are? Do you ever think about space?”</b> I ask her.

                "I keep fixating on dying, and thinking about why we exist, and how sad everything is. 
                I've been starting to think that the only thing that matters is that people feel happy, 
                and I was trying to spare you some sadness. I keep noticing so many people aren't happy, 
                and it's been making me feel sick. I keep looking at everyone and thinking, Oh my God,
                I just want them to smile. I keep staring at peoples mouths. Do you know what I mean? 
                I keep thinking, Oh my God, I just wish you were smiling.”

                <br>
                Rosemary nods. "Yes, I have thought about that too.” She looks at my mouth.
