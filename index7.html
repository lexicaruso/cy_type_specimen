                 <p><b>I think I’ve discovered what happiness is:</b>
                <br>
                whistling the moment you wake up,
                <br>
                not getting in anyone’s way, 
                <br>
                owing no explanations,
                <br>
                and falling into bed at daybreak,
                <br>
                body addled from exhaustion 
                and mind free of every last trace of bitternest and dust.
                </p>
                </div>

        <div class="quote2">
            <p>Language is and always will be an occupied territory. 
            I have the feeling I was shackled to it the moment I was born. 
            <b>Only language can help you belong somewhere and make sure you don’t lose your way.</b>
            </p>
        </div>
        

        <div class="quote3">
        <p>No emotion is more indulgent than the feeling that you are <b>intensely human.</b>
                Though it can also be the most tyrannical. 
                You are responsible for every word, and no statement is innocent.
                </p>
